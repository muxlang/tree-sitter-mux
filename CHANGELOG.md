# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-07-13

First changelog for `tree-sitter-mux` as a standalone, independently versioned
repo, extracted from the former monorepo. The grammar version lives in
`tree-sitter.json` and is released on its own cadence when the grammar or queries
change.

### Added
- **Where-clause grammar**: Added `where`-clause support to the grammar (#7).

### Changed
- **Vendored spec parity check**: CI now verifies the vendored `syntax-matrix.json`
  against the canonical copy in `mux-syntax-highlighting` so the grammar cannot
  drift from the spec (#2).
- **Standalone repo setup**: Established as an independent repo with CLAUDE.md/AGENTS
  linking the muxlang/mux-context hub.

### Fixed
- **Range syntax**: Fixed the range syntax in `validation.mux` and removed the
  invented `range_expression` rule that did not match the language (#9).

> **Independent multi-repo versioning begins at 0.5.0.** Entries below are inherited

## [0.4.1] - 2026-06-27

### Fixed
- **Windows CI linker failure (`xml2.lib`)**: The conda-forge `libxml2` packages do not install any `.lib` import library into `Library/lib/`, causing `LNK1181: cannot open input file 'xml2.lib'` on `windows-latest` runners. Fixed by adding a dedicated step after MSVC toolchain setup that generates `xml2.lib` from the installed `libxml2*.dll` using `dumpbin /exports` and `lib.exe`.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-06-26

### Added
- **Mux AI documentation assistant**: In-docs chat widget powered by a Cloudflare Worker (RAG over `mux-website/docs/` via Vectorize + Llama 3.3 70B). Answers Mux questions with citations, explains compiler errors, and rejects off-topic queries. Includes `tools/docs-indexer/` for re-indexing and `tools/retrieval-test/` eval harness (8/8 retrieval, 19/19 error-explainer). Full runbook in `workers/mux-ai/README.md`.
- **DSA stdlib expanded**: Added `algorithm.mux` (generic graph algorithms: topological sort, cycle detection, DFS, BFS), `graph.mux` (adjacency-list directed graph), `bintree.mux` (binary tree with inorder/preorder/postorder traversals), `heap.mux` (min/max heap), `queue.mux` (FIFO), `stack.mux` (LIFO), and `collection.mux` (base Collection interface). Closes #203.
- **`to_char()` conversion method**: Implemented `string.to_char() -> result<char, string>` and `int.to_char() -> char` (Unicode code-point to char). Closes #207.
- **`to_list()` on set and map**: `set<T>.to_list()` and `map<K,V>.to_list()` now registered and callable. Closes #209.

### Changed
- **LLVM upgraded from 17 to 22**: Migrated inkwell dependency and all CI/build tooling to LLVM 22, which is more broadly available and actively maintained. Closes #215.
- **Dead code elimination**: Unused symbols (variables, classes, enums, functions, generics) are no longer emitted to LLVM IR, reducing binary size and intermediate output. Closes #200.
- **Minimal end-user installation**: End-user installs now ship only the compiler binary and runtime; development tooling (LLVM, clang, analysis tools) is separated into the dev setup path. Closes #193.
- **God Object refactor**: Broke down oversized structs/impls in the compiler (semantic analyzer, codegen context) into smaller focused components. Closes #194.
- **Improved error messages for collection types**: Set and map type errors now display `set<T>` and `map<K,V>` instead of raw brace-syntax (`{char}`, `{string: int}`). Closes #210.
- **Improved error for `.new()` on built-in collections**: Calling `list.new()`, `map.new()`, or `set.new()` now emits a helpful diagnostic suggesting `[]` or `{}` literal syntax instead of a generic undefined-type error. Closes #204.
- **SonarQube and Greptile cleanups**: Addressed code quality findings across multiple passes: god-object decomposition, vulnerability dependency updates, and ESLint/security-hotspot fixes in the website.

### Fixed
- **`void` functions require explicit `return`**: Functions declared `returns void` without a `return` statement now produce a compile-time error instead of silently compiling. Closes #211.
- **Map `{}` literal compiled as Set**: `map<K,V> m = {}` previously produced a `Value::Set` at runtime, causing segfaults on map operations. Fixed by resolving `{}` type contextually during semantic analysis (`SetOrMapLiteral`) so codegen emits `mux_new_map` vs `mux_new_set` correctly.
- **Struct layout corruption in interface-implementing classes**: Inline constructor initialization used positional field indices instead of the interface-aware field map, causing the first real field's data to overwrite the vtable slot. Affected all classes implementing interfaces.
- **Non-primitive field initialization in class constructors**: Non-generic class constructors (e.g., `Graph.new()`) zero-initialized `list`/`map`/`set` fields as null instead of real empty collections.
- **Generic class vtable generation crash**: `generate_class_vtables()` attempted to build vtables using unspecialized method names (e.g., `Graph.len`) which do not exist; generic classes only have monomorphized instances. Vtable generation is now skipped for generic classes (interfaces use static dispatch).
- **Cross-module import ordering**: `collect_hoistable_declarations()` ran before imports were resolved, so classes in a file could not see imported interfaces during the hoisting pass. Imports are now processed during hoisting; `expression_type_overrides` from submodules are also merged so empty `{}` literals are correctly disambiguated. Closes #203.
- **`Type::Module` panic**: `resolve_type_with_seen()` and `llvm_type_from_resolved_type()` panicked on `Type::Module` instead of returning `Err`, breaking `module.CONST.method()` call patterns.
- **Website frontend examples**: Audited and corrected all code examples and interactive demos on the documentation site; removed a stale debug log from the compiler.
- **Dependency vulnerabilities**: Updated website and tooling dependencies to resolve known CVEs.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-06-13

### Changed
- **SonarQube quality issues resolved**: Replaced `unreachable!()` in `deep_clone_value` for `Value::Object` inside containers, fixed UB in sync unlock arm, replaced 7 `.expect()` calls with proper error propagation, and extracted duplicate constructor helpers.
- **Code duplication reduced**: Overall project duplication dropped from 4.5% to 3.9%. Extracted module-level expression helpers in `methods.rs`, merged duplicate equality and return value arms in `statements.rs`, and added signature macros to compact ~40 runtime function declarations.
- **Version metadata updated**: All configuration files bumped from 0.3.1 to 0.3.2.

### Fixed
- **Segfault when running `cargo test`**: `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` was checked before `DT_RUNPATH`, so the workspace `.so` was loaded instead of the cached release `.so`. Added `-Wl,--disable-new-dtags` to force `DT_RPATH`, which is checked before `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.
- **LLD linker flags**: Removed `-no-pie` flag to fix LLD compatibility on modern Linux distributions.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-07

### Added
- **Syntax highlighting support**: Added TextMate and Tree-sitter grammar support with setup guidance for VSCode, Sublime Text, JetBrains, Neovim, and Helix.
- **Setup documentation**: New `mux-website/docs/setup.md` with language installation and editor configuration guides.

### Changed
- **Profiling decoupled**: Removed built-in profiling infrastructure (`mux-profiling` crate) from compiler and runtime. Profiling now uses external tools (perf, Instruments, WPA) only.
- **Code quality improvements**: Pinned GitHub Actions versions, added `--locked` to cargo commands, added Cargo.lock files, refactored Python and JavaScript generators to fix SonarQube findings.

### Fixed
- **Code review cleanup**: Removed orphaned profiling scripts, cleaned up empty scope blocks in compiler, and fixed numbered list in CONTRIBUTING.md.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-04-22

### Changed
- **Compiler maintainability work**: Reduced complexity across compiler modules with a broad cleanup and refactor pass.
- **Standard library internals**: Refactored and optimized stdlib implementations for better consistency and maintainability.
- **Developer workflow and project metadata**: Updated AI agent guidance, OpenCode configuration, and supporting repository automation files.
- **Documentation and website updates**: Improved README content and landing page structure, examples, and installation guidance.

### Fixed
- **Codegen regressions**: Fixed recent LLVM IR generation regressions and related import handling issues.
- **Website behavior**: Corrected landing page rendering details, including list key usage and stack example behavior.
- **Build and CI support scripts**: Fixed tooling and script issues affecting local and CI workflows.
- **Versioning release prep**: Synced release metadata and version-related files for `0.2.1`.
